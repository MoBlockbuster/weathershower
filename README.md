# weathershower
A little tool to show the current weather in your citiy. It is a nice greeting if you open your shell

## Usage:

- You can start me as normal script
- You can start me with parameter **-g** and you will get the current weather of city of your choice
- Use parameter **-v** to check the current version

If you close your shell and open it again, you will see the weather of $CITY

**Cheers**
